* Making the world better (or worse)
	Who will benefit, and how, from massive data about each one of us? 
 * Expect ever more integrated apps. mail+calendar+itinery+money is just the start.
 * Expect ever more data in big dbs about individuals (1 petabyte = 3mb
 for every person in the US)
 * Expect simulation and prediction at the individual level
 

# Project Ideas

## Generate optimized hash table from LLVM

* LLVM APIs
* Data structure(s) (hash table)

## Recommendation engine for level-appropriate reading material for language learners

* Machine learning
* PaaS / AWS
* Web crawling & indexing for classification and search
 
## Build a virtual machine (and/or emulator?)

Emulate a simple-ish 8-bit chip?

## Write a toy compiler

Self hosted! Lisp? 

## Some cool lego robot with an arduino on it
